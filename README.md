2) Will be stripped to just audio

3) Audio is transcribed and an SRT file is generated for the transcription

4) Transcription is sliced word-for-word and times are split

5) New SRT is printed onto new mp4 screen in font that the user chose.

6) Images are generated that take in the context of the subtitles.

7) Effects are generated for each image and the images are blitted onto screen.

8) New form is generated that allows user to "check" what they want to add to the video.
